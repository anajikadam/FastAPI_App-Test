If you want to deploy your Flask web app to an existing Azure Virtual Machine (VM) instead of using Azure Web App service, you can do so by configuring a deployment pipeline to deploy your code directly to that VM. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Prepare your VM**: Ensure that your VM is set up properly to host your Flask web app. This includes installing necessary dependencies like Python, Flask, and any other libraries your app requires. Also, make sure your VM is accessible over the internet or within your network.
2. **SSH Access**: Ensure you have SSH access to your VM. You'll need this to copy files and execute commands on the VM from your pipeline.
3. **Set up Azure Repos**: Similar to the previous steps, create a repository in Azure Repos to host your Flask web app's source code.
4. **Create Azure Pipelines**: Set up Azure Pipelines to automate the deployment process. You can do this through the Azure DevOps portal.
5. **Configure Pipeline YAML**: Write a YAML file to define your pipeline. This file should specify the steps required to build your Flask web app and deploy it to your VM.
6. **Define Build Steps**: Define the steps needed to build your Flask app. This might involve installing dependencies, running tests, and generating any required artifacts.
7. **Define Deployment Steps**: Define the steps needed to deploy your Flask app to your VM. This could involve copying your code to the VM, installing dependencies, and starting your Flask app.
8. **Trigger Pipeline**: Once your pipeline is defined, trigger it to start the build and deployment process.

Here's an example of what your pipeline YAML file might look like:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: |
    python --version
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python test.py  # Run tests if you have them
  displayName: 'Install dependencies and run tests'

- task: CopyFilesOverSSH@0
  inputs:
    sshEndpoint: '<SSHConnection>'
    sourceFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)'
    contents: '**'
    targetFolder: '/path/to/destination/on/VM'

- script: |
    ssh <username>@<vm-ip-address> "cd /path/to/destination/on/VM && python your_app.py"
  displayName: 'Start Flask app on VM'
```

Replace `<SSHConnection>` with your SSH connection name, `<username>` with your VM's username, `<vm-ip-address>` with your VM's public or private IP address, and `/path/to/destination/on/VM` with the path where you want to deploy your app on the VM.

Adjust this example to match your project structure and requirements. Ensure that your VM is properly configured to run your Flask web app and that your SSH connection is set up correctly. Additionally, make sure your Azure service connection has the necessary permissions to access your VM.
